## About the Project

DNDGO is a full stack web app, that aims to connect people interested in tabletop role playing games, such as Dungeons and Dragons. In this hobby it is sometimes difficult for players to meet new people that also enjoy the hobby in your area. This application aims to solve this problem by utilizing user locations to connect people in a geographic range. By doing this the app will negate some of the anxiety and stress of finding people that enjoy this hobby as well.
